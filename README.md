To execute the application through the GUI. There are two methods: one. Calling the GUI directly through the command python gui.py is for people who do not want to install the app on their machines for various reasons. Second, calling the build command python build.py creates an executable installer for Windows machines, which we can then use to execute the app and pin on our taskbar.
